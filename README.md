Sales per Department: Evaluating the sales contributions of different departments within the company to identify strengths and areas needing improvement.

Top Customers: Determining who the top customers are, their purchasing behaviors, and how they contribute to overall revenue.

Shipment Modes: Understanding how different shipment methods impact sales and customer satisfaction.

# Technical Challenges
